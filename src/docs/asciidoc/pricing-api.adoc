== Pricing Service Discovery (GCP - internal-load-balancing)

All the pricing microservices are using internal load balancer, and will use all the instances of each microservices. They are capable to use
all features of Google Kubernetes Engine.

https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/internal-load-balancing

Internal load balancer
In a mixed environment it is sometimes necessary to route traffic from services inside the same VPC.

In a split-horizon DNS environment you would need two services to be able to route both external and internal traffic to your endpoints.

This can be achieved by adding the following annotations to the service based on cloud provider.

metadata:
    name: price-service
    annotations:
        cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"


== Pricing Services Exception Handling

image::RESTExceptionHandling.png[title="Exception Handling Flow"]


Across all Pricing microservices, some things to note are as follows:

@ControllerAdvice: Class with Controller Advice annotation, by default, is applicable to all controllers.

@ExceptionHandler (value= Exception/Custom Exception.class): Any method with this annotation will be called when an exception of the type or the sub-type of class specified (Exception.class) is thrown in controller. So, method with @Exceptionhandler annotation is called whenever an exception is thrown and the exception from the controller class matches the configured Exception classes.

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400 or status code >= 500) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The developers can customize the error/exception messages. For example, few error object has the
following structure:

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

Failed Get Price by Id Request

GET http://localhost:8101/price/2 <- plugin correct api


RESPONSE

{
  "status": "404”,
  "message": "price not found for  id [2]”,
  "timestamp": 1518188855084
}

Failed GET price by division

GET http://localhost:8101/price/nn


RESPONSE

{
    "status": "404",
    "message": "No price found for the division [nn]",
    "timestamp": 1518189938450
}




== Logging Framework
Pricing Services Logging / Monitoring framework is divided into two streams:

(1) Application Logging going through GCP log aggregator and to GCP StackDriver

(2) Prometheus and Grafana are used to collect specific metrics that need to be monitored such as used memory and storage as well as general ones reporting on the status of the service.
Conveniently, Prometheus exposes a wide variety of metrics that can be easily monitored. By adding Grafana as a visualization layer, we can easily set up a monitoring stack for our monitoring stack.

We are finalizing this. Please stay tuned for a next version of this doc.

The Issue resource is used to list all issues and a particular issue given an ID
